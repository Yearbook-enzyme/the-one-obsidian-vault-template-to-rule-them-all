# the-one-obsidian-vault-template-to-rule-them-all

# pro-tip:
make obsidian your own, i think i provide a pretty good entire vault structure but the structure that works best for you will be the one that you create yourself based on your own needs/wants, make this vault your own if something is missing from it or you would like it to function in a different way.

# obsidian is neccessary to use an obsidian vault i think
here is a link to download obsidian https://obsidian.md/download

# USE SYNCTHING/MOBIUS TO SYNC YOUR VAULT BETWEEN DEVICES ON YOUR WIFI!
syncthing can be found here https://syncthing.net/downloads/
it is available on pc/android only, for ios you must use mobius
which i have no experience with and cant help you use,
mobius can be found here https://www.mobiussync.com/
there arent many great alternatives to syncing your vault
between devices that arent either something you have to pay for
or are handing off your data to cloud servers

# some explanations of certain things

# description
its a obsidian vault template which covers most
aspects of my life and was born out of my own lack up
discipline and was created largely with chatgpt.

# no community plugins are utilized in this vault so there is nothing extra to install

# examples in the vault that can be deleted
any of the folders or notes that say "delete this..." are
structure examples that use the respective templates for their
part of the vault, all templates can be found in the template folder.

# business folder is untouched and ready for you to make a folder structure
i have left the business folder mostly untouched except
for a todo list to allow you to learn how to make
structures yourself based on the ones provided.

# questions to change in dailies/yearlies templates
the dailies and yearlies templates have questions which
you must change to something more specific to you,
i have left "maker" in them as an example.

# important detail about tags
the media logging templates and the dream journaling template
and the internet chunking template utilize tags which are
hidden `#like this/extra-detail` so as to not interfere
with the real notes and must be unhidden and have the
words changed to fit the example structure.

# how to backlink notes
there are places in the templates that say to backlink,
backlinking looks like this [[choose-folder/note]].

# how to attach/embed and image in a note
you may have to attach an image to a note from time to time,
the default folder for embedded media is aptly named "embedded media",
embedding looks like this ![[your-image-you-want-to-embed.file-extension]],
_on desktop_ you will have to drag and drop the image into a note in the
"embedded media" folder first before the image will show in your other note,
obsidian may or may not create a note underneath the image you put in the
"embedded media" folder, this new note can be deleted,
i do not know how to keep obsidian from doing that. _on mobile_ you will instead
click the attachment button upon creating a note in the "embedded media" folder
and then type ![[your-image-you-want-to-embed.file-extension]]
to embed the image on your other note.

# telling obsidian where stuff is located
you may have to tell obsidian where the attachments folder is located
in the settings menu under "Files & Links" and that folder is "embedded media",
you may also have to tell obsidian where the templates folder is located
in the settings menu under "Templates" and that folder is "templates",
while you are there you can also set your desired date and
time formats which my templates make extensive use of.

# Thankyou for taking the time to read!
